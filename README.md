Malicious URL Detection Bot for Discord
Overview
This project develops a Discord bot that enhances cybersecurity by leveraging advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms to detect and analyze malicious URLs. Designed to integrate seamlessly with Discord servers, this bot provides real-time analysis of URLs, helping users identify and avoid potential cyber threats. The bot utilizes a combination of Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forests (RF), and C4.5 decision tree algorithms to assess the maliciousness of URLs compared against a database enriched by VirusTotal and URLscan.io.

Features
Real-Time URL Analysis: Instantly analyzes URLs submitted by users within any Discord server.
Advanced Machine Learning Models: Incorporates SVM, RF, and C4.5 algorithms for accurate detection of malicious URLs.
Integration with VirusTotal and URLscan.io: Leverages external APIs to enhance detection capabilities with comprehensive threat data.
User-Friendly Interactions: Simple command-based interactions for users to check URLs and receive feedback on potential threats.
Continuous Learning and Updates: Regularly updated ML models to adapt to new and evolving cyber threats.
